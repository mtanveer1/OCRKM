# OCRKM - One Class Restricted Kernel Machines


Please cite the following paper if you are using this code. 

A. Quadir, M. Sajid, M. Tanveer (2024). "One Class Restricted Kernel Machines, 31st International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP), 2024".

The experiments are executed on a computing system possessing Python 3.11 software, an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2697 v4 processor operating at 2.30 GHz with 128-GB Random Access Memory (RAM), and a Windows-11 operating platform.

*Installation*

Our OCRKM implementation requires the following dependencies:

- Python (>=3.7)
- NumPy (>=1.13)
- SciPy

Usage

The following are the best hyperparameters set with respect to the “chess_krvkp” dataset

Regularization Parameter c_1=1, c_2= 1, sig=1

Description of files:

main.py: This is the main file to run selected algorithms on datasets. In the path variable specificy the path to the folder containing the codes and datasets on which you wish to run the algorithm.
One-RKM.py: Solving the optimization problem.

For a comprehensive understanding of the experimental setup, please refer to the paper. Should you encounter any bugs or issues, feel free to contact A. Quadir at mscphd2207141002@iiti.ac.in or abdulquadir19991@gmail.com.
